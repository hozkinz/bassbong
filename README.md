## A midi controller that outputs bass via a subwoofer to the users mouth.

Please note, this is just the code, for use with Arduino. This is revision 1.0 - ie it works. It will be updated in the future, but maybe this can help anyone looking for an introduction into simple midi devices.

Uses an Arduino Leonardo, 3 momentary switches (Gateron whites) and a single potentiometer for pitch control. Also uses salvaged parts from a broken polaroid subwoofer.

Requires MIDIUSB.h: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MIDIUSB

I've done my best to comment the code to show what goes where. But maybe the video will help if you want to make your own.
